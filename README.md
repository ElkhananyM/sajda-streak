# Sajda Streak ðŸ¤–

A motivational Discord bot for tracking your daily masjid prayers and celebrating every milestone on the road to 40 consecutive days streak!
The bot tracks and responds privately, to avoid invoking Reya'a, and is meant as a tool to help brothers stay consistent in congregations.
